# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-22)

**Core value:** Unread articles I care about most appear at the top of a Priority view, ranked by a score that reflects my stated interests and my thumbs up/down feedback, without ever breaking or slowing feed polling.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Dependency upgrade (Phase 1) precedes all Jev work; TypeSafe starter 0.1.0 targets Boot 4.0.7
- Roadmap: Whole V6 schema ships in Phase 3; the feedback tables must support per-topic penalization (FDBK-06)
- Roadmap: Question/state builders land in Phase 3 (needed by INT-04 preview and the calibration spike); Phase 4 reuses them
- Roadmap: `/api/interest/status` starts in Phase 2/3 (configured + breaker state); JEV-05 is completed in Phase 4 with counts
- Roadmap: Manual "Re-score unread" (INT-05) is implemented on the Phase 4 sweep (delete in-scope score rows, let the sweep drain)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: calibration spike needs a live `MYFEEDER_TYPESAFE_API_KEY`
- Phase 4: verify jsoup is on the classpath via Readability4J (or add it explicitly)
- Phase 7: 429 behavior during launch backfill is unobserved; fallback is concurrency 1 or the SDK retry layer (keep exactly one)
